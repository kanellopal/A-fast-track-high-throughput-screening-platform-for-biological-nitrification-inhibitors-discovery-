This is a script that includes all the necessary code to reproduce the results from the respective manuscript.

The results produced refer to Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 8. EC50 values are shown in Figure 4.

It is noted that the script works with 2 examples, one for each of the modelling approaches. However, for all NIs that yielded a decisive EC50 value, mat tables are provided with the necessary data. EC50, accompanied with the standard error was each time determined by the reliable dose-inhibition % pairs. Refer to Supplementary Figure S8 to see the reliable pairs selected.
