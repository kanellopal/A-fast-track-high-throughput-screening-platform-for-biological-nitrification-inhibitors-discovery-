**Figure S1. Nitrosospira multiformis fast – track assay protocol standardisation.** (A) Box plot of pooled qPCR results for the different points of the cell harvesting procedure. The y – axis values correspond to cell density, while the five different points of the procedure are plotted on the x – axis. The black dashed line represents the limit below which the box plot is not to scale. Lowercase letters above the boxes indicate the grouping according to the Kruskal – Wallis test. (B) Line plots of qPCR results between consecutive tests of the cell harvesting procedure. Different tests are represented by different colours according to the legend. The coloured error bars represent the range between -1 and +1 standard deviation from the mean value. The black dashed line indicates the limit below which the line plot is not to scale. (C) Activity curve of N. multiformis fast – track culture (magenta lines) compared to the activity model curve of the respective routine cultures (blue line). The points represent individual nitrite values from the biological replicates at each time-point of each fast – track culture. The R2 value refers to the linear regression of the pooled fast – track culture data.
